## Aim of the article and pre-requisites

By the end of this hands-on tutorial you should be familiar with:

* common misconceptions in the analysis of missing participants in systematic
reviews with **aggregate data**;
* the pattern-mixture model and why it is the preferred method to deal with missing
participants when synthesising the trials; 
* conducting Bayesian network meta-analysis with missing participants using 
the novel **R package** [**rnmamod**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rnmamod/index.html), and;
* the rich visualisation toolkit of the rnmamod that aims to assist you in critically
appraising your results.

The minimum required knowledge to benefit from the article includes being familiar
with:

* the assumptions, concept and the technical details of network meta-analysis;
* the Bayesian framework and related advances in evidence synthesis, and;
* the reporting requirements of network meta-analysis following the corresponding 
PRISMA extension statement [(Hutton et al., 2015)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26030634/). 

## A familiar background in systematic reviews

You are leading a research project that involves conducting a systematic review
with multiple interventions for a specific health condition and patient population.
You and your team have spent a considerable amount of time and energy to set-up 
a protocol of high standards and you have registered the protocol to [PROSPERO register](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/). You have exhausted the (re)sources 
to search, retrieve and select the relevant trials that will represent your target 
population as close as possible. 

The data extraction is coming to an end, and you are looking forward to uncovering 
the best interventions for the investigated condition. Everybody is motivated, and 
overwhelmed, yet quite stressed to keep up with the deadlines of the project. You 
pour some coffee in your favorite mug and you start the analysis. You notice that 
many eligible trials report to have missing participants. 
**How are you going to proceed with the analysis?** 

## The good, the bad, and the ugly 

Consider the following fictional small trial in [Figure 1](#fig:fictional-example) 
for illustration: 20 participants have been randomised to two interventions. The 
outcome is binary, such as the symptoms have improved or deteriorated after receiving 
the randomised intervention. Some participants have completed the trial (called 
completers), and others left the trial prematurely for several reasons (called 
missing). We are interested in drawing conclusions using **the whole randomised sample**.

```{r fictional, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", out.height = "15%", fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Figure 1: A fictional small trial of two interventions", fig.alt=""}
knitr::include_graphics("./gigures/fictional.png")
```

Let's be honest; without access to individual patient data, there are only a few 
methods to address missing participants in meta-analysis:

1. **exclude** missing participants under the assumption that their outcome is 
missing for reasons unrelated to the planning and conduct of the trial 
(**missing completely at random, MCAR**) or their missing outcome is attributed 
to their baseline characteristics (**missing at random, MAR**),
2. **impute** missing participants under the assumption that they would have 
experienced improvement or deterioration of their symptoms, had they never left 
the trial (**missing not at random, MNAR**) and take this assumption for granted,
3. **model** the missingness mechanism (i.e., M(C)AR or MNAR) assuming a probability 
distribution that describes the association between the missing participants and  
the completers concerning their outcomes (**pattern-mixture model**).

### Exclusion

As you may have guessed, **exclusion** and **imputation** are suboptimal methods 
to handle missing participants. **Exclusion** is illustrated in 
[Figure 2](#fig:excluded): missing participants in both interventions 
are removed from the dataset before conducting the analysis. This methods is 
inappropriate for the goals of our study, where we aim to draw conclusions for the 
whole randomised sample, as it reduces the sample to those participants who remained 
in the trial. Consequently, the power to detect a statistically significant 
association is also reduced. Moreover, if the missingness mechanism is not M(C)AR, 
the risk of estimating a biased intervention effect (e.g. odds ratio) is imminent. 

```{r excluded, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", out.height = "15%", fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Figure 2: Excluding missing participants from both interventions", fig.alt=""}
knitr::include_graphics("./gigures/excluded.png")
```

### Imputation

[Figure 3](#fig:imputed) illustrates the **imputation**: all missing participants 
in the first intervention have been assumed to have experienced improvement of 
their symptoms (and thus, they left the trial prematurely), whilst all missing 
participants in the second intervention have been assumed to have experienced 
deterioration of their symptoms (and thus, they left the trial prematurely). 
Imputation implies adding the number of missing participants to the outcome 
dictated by the corresponding scenario: to the number of events (improvement) in 
the first intervention, and to the number of non-events (deterioration) in the 
second intervention. This method maintains the randomised sample but takes the 
missingness scenario for granted. Without following the missing participants to 
record their outcome, we cannot know the **true missingness mechanism**. Hence, 
any assumptions we make about the missingness mechanism should naturally propagate 
in the estimation of the intervention effect by increasing its standard error. 
Imputation rears its ugly head by 'treating' the missing participants as observed, 
increasing the risk to estimate a biased intervention effect and draw spurious 
conclusions regarding the statistical significance.

```{r imputed, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", out.height = "15%", fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Figure 3: Imputing missing participants making different scenarios in each intervention", fig.alt=""}
knitr::include_graphics("./gigures/imputed.png")
```

It is needless to say that meta-analysis inherits the limitations of exclusion 
and imputation observed at trial-level via the inclusion of studies with missing 
participants, giving you a real headache. Remember, you do not have individual 
patient data to make use of different cool methods for missing participants. Hence, 
the quality of the meta-analysis results will strongly dependent, among others, 
on your *good guess* about the missingness mechanism and how you incorporated 
this *good guess* into the results having access only to a handful of methods with 
some being suboptimal. We have good news on that; just, keep reading. 

### Pattern-mixture model

The last member of the squad of methods for missing participants in meta-analysis
is the pattern-mixture model. The **pattern-mixture model** circumvents the limitations 
of exclusion and imputation elegantly: it adjusts, rather than fixes, the average 
outcome (here, the risk of event) to the assumed missingness mechanism, and propagates 
this assumption to the standard error of the estimated intervention effect, while 
maintaining the randomised sample. It also allows the assumption about the missing
mechanism to differ between the interventions or across the trials. Therefore, the 
pattern-mixture model offers a flexible modelling framework to handle missing participants 
in meta-analysis properly. If exclusion, imputation and pattern-mixture model were 
characters from the epic Western spaghetti film, *The Good, the Bad and the Ugly*, 
the correspondence of who would be who is quite obvious.

[Figure 4](#fig:imor) illustrates two normal distributions of the 
**informative missingness odds ratio (IMOR)**, a central parameter in the 
pattern-mixture model for a binary outcome. IMOR resembles the odds ratio for
two interventions: it compares the odds of an event in missing participants with 
the odds of an event in completers. IMOR equal to 1 coincides with the MAR mechanism 
(i.e., no difference in the compared groups), and IMOR different from 1 implies 
the MNAR mechanism (i.e., the compared groups differ). 
As an illustration, we have considered a different IMOR distribution for each 
intervention: the first intervention is assumed to have *on average* twice the 
odds of an event in completers than that in missing participants (the mode), with 
other scenarios being less and less likely to occur as we deviate from the mode. 
On the contrary, the second intervention is assumed to have on average twice 
the odds of an event in missing participants than that in completers (the mode), 
again, with other scenarios being less and less likely to occur as we deviate 
from the mode. An important technical detail is that the normal distributions 
presented in [Figure 4](#fig:imor) are implied for the IMOR in the logarithmic 
scale, also commonly considered when estimating the odds ratio.

## The versatility of the rnmamod R package <img src="gigures/hexsticker_rnmamod.png" align="right" width="170" />    

Originally, we developed the rnmamod R package as a response to facilitate handling 
aggregate missing participants in the absence of relevant functions in the available 
R packages for pairwise and network meta-analysis. Since then, one thing led to 
another and we ended up expanding our goals to set-up a comprehensive suite of 
functions to perform and visualise pairwise and network meta-analysis. Proper 
handling of missing participants remains fundamental and is implemented using the 
pattern-mixture model in all models of the package. The rest of the tutorial walks 
you down to the core functions of the package to perform network meta-analysis 
and obtain a compact, yet comprehensive visual summarisation of a large volume of 
results. 

### Let's get started

You may install and load the package directly from CRAN by running the code below:

    install.packages("rnmamod")
    library(rnmamod)

or install the development version of the package running the following code:

    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("LoukiaSpin/rnmamod")


We will use the dataset of [Baker et al. (2009)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19637942/) that includes 21 trials comparing seven pharmacological interventions with each other and placebo in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. We are interested in whether the patients experienced COPD exacerbation after receiving the randomised intervention. Run the code below to glance at the dataset. The dataset has the one-trial-per-row format, which is the typical format encountered in models written in the BUGS language. 

``` r
head(nma.baker2009)

```

### Network plot

Let's Create the network plot using the *nma.networkplot* function of the [pcnetmeta](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=netmeta) R package:
  
  ``` r
# The names of the interventions in the order they appear in the dataset
interv_names <- c("placebo", "budesonide", "budesonide plus formoterol", "fluticasone", "fluticasone plus salmeterol", "formoterol", "salmeterol", "tiotropium")

netplot(data = nma.baker2009, drug_names = interv_names, text.cex = 1.5)
```
